# FreaKompare

FreaKompare is designed and optimised in Projucer as a plug in for Ableton Live 9.7.2

It uses spectral analysis to compare the volume of a variable frequency
band in different audio tracks.

//======================================================================

To use in your DAW, simply add it to a track in your and send your second 
track to the sidechain input of FreaKompare.

In Ableton, this would mean sending the second track to a return which is
routed to the sidechain input of FreaKompare from the "outputs" drop down 
box of this return track.

Now adjust the central vertical slider to compare the tracks against each
other at the same frequency using the meters either side of the GUI.

//======================================================================

To compile in Juce, copy and replace the source folder of a new plug-in 
with the four files in this download. Then add the "DSP" module in the 
projucer application, save and compile.
