# FreaKompare

FreaKompare is designed and optimised as a plug in for Ableton Live 9.7.2

It uses spectral analysis to compare the volume of a variable frequency band 
in different audio tracks.

To set it up, simply add it to a channel in your track and send your second track
to a return which is routed to the sidechain input of FreaKompare from the outputs
drop down box of this return track.

Now adjust the central vertical slider to compare the tracks against each other
at the same frequency using the meters either side of the GUI.
